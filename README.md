## Example Code (2D)

Here's an example of how to create a simple 2D game using GoGo Engine:

```cpp
#include <gogo/gogo.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize the engine
    gogo::Engine engine;

    // Create a 2D scene
    gogo::Scene2D scene;

    // Create a sprite
    gogo::Sprite sprite("assets/player.png");
    sprite.setPosition(400, 300);

    // Add the sprite to the scene
    scene.addObject(sprite);

    // Game loop
    while (engine.isRunning()) {
        // Update game logic
        // Render the scene
        engine.render(scene);
    }

    // Clean up and exit
    engine.shutdown();
    return 0;
}
```
